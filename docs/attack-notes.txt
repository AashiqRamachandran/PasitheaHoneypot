Data Collection Algorithm:

attacks = {DoS, DDoS}  // we’ll add more later
traffic = {normal_only, attack_only, normal_and_attack}
numruns = 1000
for a in attacks {
   for t in traffic {
      logFileName = “attack “ + a + “ traffic “ + t + “.log”
      createLogFile(logFileName)
      for i = 0 to numruns-1 {
         launchAttackAndLogData(a, t, logFileName)
      end for      
   end for
end for

Things to do to get started: 

1. Work with Robert on getting yourself an isolated network environment so that these attacks are contained and don’t take down Banner or GitHub or Valve’s Steam servers. 
2. Work with Casimer on getting and using software to perform these attacks.
3. Work with me on the format of the log file, insuring that we can easily manipulate it. (My suggestion: CSV which we can directly import into Weka and easily turn into SQL insert statements, and therefore easily turn into G* graphs. What more could we want?) 
4. Work with Matthew on the programming for all of this.
